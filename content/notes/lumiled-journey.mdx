LumiLED started as a simple curiosity: How can we replicate the tactile, glowing feel of old arcade LED boards on modern high-resolution screens?

The project evolved into a sophisticated Flutter application. The core challenge wasn't just drawing dots, but making them *feel* alive. We implemented custom particle systems to simulate the "bleeding" of light between pixels and used P2P networking for **Sync Mode**.

Design-wise, we leaned heavily into the **Neo-Retro** aesthetic. It's about taking the constraints of the past and blowing them out with the power of modern hardware. Deep blacks, glowing oranges, and perfectly aligned grids.

As we move toward a public release, the focus is now on performance optimization and building a robust preset system for creators.
